# 📖 Text Generation with Markov Chains

## 📌 Internship Task - Prodigy InfoTech (Generative AI Intern)

As part of my internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**, I implemented a **Markov Chain-based text generation system**, focused on story creation. This project deepened my understanding of probabilistic models, natural language generation, and creative applications of AI in storytelling.

## 🛠️ Implementation Overview

✅ **Markov Chain-Based Text Model**  
- Built a custom n-gram (state-size) model using Markov Chains.  
- Tokenized and cleaned training data to preserve sentence structure and track sentence starters.

✅ **Training Process**  
- Trained the model on a diverse corpus of fictional stories ranging from fantasy and sci-fi to detective and magical themes.  
- Constructed transition probabilities between word states for text generation.

✅ **Interactive Story Generator**  
- Created a CLI-based interface allowing users to:
  - Generate random or prompt-based stories
  - Train on new story data
  - Customize output length and model state size

✅ **Prompt-Aware Generation**  
- Included logic to find the best starting state based on keywords from the user’s input prompt.

✅ **Model Statistics and Debug Info**  
- Added functions to display model state counts, top transitions, and generation stats for evaluation.

## 🖼️ Output Sample

> 📝 *Generated short stories based on prompts like "space exploration", "fantasy adventure", and "haunted house".*

Example:
```
Prompt: "fantasy adventure"
Story: The young wizard Harry practiced his spells in the ancient library. Magic filled the air as he cast enchantments and created potions. The spaceship landed on the alien planet with a loud crash. The knight rode his horse through the enchanted forest.
```

## 💡 Features

- 🧠 **Markov Chain Logic**: Predicts next word based on preceding words.
- 🎯 **Prompt Matching**: Context-aware start state based on input prompt.
- 🔁 **Story Flow**: Sentence starters ensure grammatical and meaningful story transitions.
- 🛠️ **State Size Control**: Users can modify n-gram size for creativity vs. coherence.
